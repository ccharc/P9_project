This Github directory contains the files used in our P9 project.

The main files are:
- config.R
- simulation_study.R
- application.R

The simulation_study.R file contains the code for the simulation study of the project, where we test the performance of the MRC and HY estimators for different parameters. The config.R file contains the configurations for the simulation study.
The application.R file contains the code for the application of the project on exchange rates tick data retrieved from www.histdata.com. Note that the data is required to be able to run this file.

The folder named "functions" contains all R-functions used in the above mentioned R-scripts.
The two result folders contain RDS files with the results from the simulation study, such that it is not necessary to run the simulations again. The results shown in the project can be found in "results_2nd_version".
